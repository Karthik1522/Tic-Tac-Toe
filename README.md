# Tic-Tac-Toe
A Simple Game Developed using C
Tic Tac Toe, also known as Noughts and Crosses, is a classic two-player game played on a 3x3 grid. In a Tic Tac Toe game implemented using C, players take turns marking empty cells in the grid with their respective symbols (usually 'X' and 'O') until one player achieves a winning condition or the game ends in a draw.
